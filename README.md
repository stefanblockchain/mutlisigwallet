# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Contract is deployed on rinkeby test network, you can see it by clicking on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x19caf4EC6E2CE810F385675f775B841FBfb7BE0b#code
